    <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>

    <p>Hello, I am April Carr.  I am an Air Force Veteran.  I served in the military from 2014 to 2018.  I have a Bachelor in Psychology(2013), Master in Health Administration(2018), and Associates in Information Technology(2021).  I enjoy learning, reading, and staying active.  I have a 5 year old son, who keeps me on my toes and head on a <strong>swivel</strong>. I enjoy taking vacations.  I try to fit in at least three<sub>(3)</sub> trips per year.  However, I hope to take four<sup>(4)</sup> trip in 2022. </p>

    <h3>HERE'S TO THE FUTURE</h3>

    <p>I have a little experience with front end development.  However, I am a little rusty after taking a break from coding.  I tried to pursue Cyber Security and AWS; however, I found out designing websites/applications was my passion.  I started this program in hopes of becoming a successful Full Stack Developer.  I have a creative mind, people person, and love computers.  By combining all of those skills, what better career is Software Development.  I look forward to working with <b>San Diego Global University</b> and classmates in the future. </p>
